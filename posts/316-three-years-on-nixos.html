            <p>This year I decided to shift yearly updates on my <code>NixOS</code> endeavours
(<a href="../posts/290-two-years-on-nixos.html">2023 instance</a>). This time
the occasion is <a href="https://nixos.org/blog/announcements/2024/nixos-2405/"><code>NixOS 24.05 release</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="system-maintenance">System maintenance</h2>
<p>Looking at the <code>git log</code> for <code>/etc/nixos</code> for the desktop system I see
the following things happening over the past year:</p>
<ul>
<li>follow <code>fonts.fonts</code> to <code>fonts.packages</code> rename (added in <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/244332">PR#244332</a>)</li>
<li>follow <code>pipewire</code> migration to <code>extraConfig</code> (added in
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/282377">PR#282377</a>).</li>
<li>follow <code>programs.gnupg.agent.pinentryFlavor</code> to
<code>programs.gnupg.agent.pinentryPackage</code> migration (added in
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/133542">PR#133542</a>).</li>
<li>follow the rename from <code>nix.unstable</code> to <code>nix.latest</code> (added in
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/305951">PR#305951</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>All four were trivial to tweak and did not cause much confusion.</p>
<p>Similar to previous year I did not have any problems related to package
build failures for any on <code>nixos-unstable</code>. Again, probably because I
tested <code>staging</code> time to time.</p>
<p>This time I had two non-trivial problems in upstream packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>problematic <code>firefox</code> update broke <code>meet</code> video streaming. It was
triggered by the use of <code>--with-system-libvpx</code> option in <code>nixpkgs</code>. That
was one of the cases where I had the luxury of bisecting the whole
system to pinpoint the bad component:
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/283010#issuecomment-1925703583" class="uri">https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/283010#issuecomment-1925703583</a>.
Local revert until the fix was shipped was trivial.</li>
<li>problematic unstable <code>6.8</code> kernel upgrade caused kernel panic in
<code>eevdf</code> scheduler. Was fixed upstream in
<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/ZicOSiEWHJJcahi%2F@yujie-X299/t/" class="uri">https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/ZicOSiEWHJJcahi%2F@yujie-X299/t/</a> around
<code>6.9</code> kernel. The crashes were nasty as scheduler crash locks up the
machine and does not print anything when it happens. Luckily
<code>systemd</code> recovered crash log from <code>EFI</code>s <code>nvram</code> and it was clear
from the backtrace that it’s a bug related to scheduling kernel
subsystem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="community-support">Community support</h2>
<p><code>NixOS</code> community remains to be a friendly place that welcomes
newcomers, experiments and day-to-day maintenance work. This year
<code>NixOS Foundation</code> received some heat for how it governs some aspects of
the community. <code>NixOS Foundation</code> proposed a
<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-foundation-board-giving-power-to-the-community/44552">few major changes</a>
on how it will operate in future.</p>
<p>The most important (and hardest organizationally) change I did was to
document and exercise the procedure of updating
<a href="../posts/315-nixpkgs-bootstrap-files-update.html">bootstrap binaries</a> in
<code>nixpkgs</code>.</p>
<p>My fanciest contribution was
<a href="../posts/309-listing-all-nixpkgs-packages.html">my failed attempt</a> at
listing “all” the package attributes available in <code>nixpkgs</code>. While I was
not able to list all the attributes initially I managed to derive about
60 fixes to <code>nixpkgs</code> (all linked in the article) to make future listing
smoother. Tl:DR; of the fixes is: dynamic typing is hard.</p>
<p>The most unusual <code>nixpkgs</code> contribution was to find
<a href="../posts/292-nix-language-nondeterminism-example.html">the non-determinism</a>
in <code>nix expression language</code> itself. It’s not something I expected to
encounter in real code. Alas.</p>
<p>The trickiest from technical standpoint was the fix for
<a href="../posts/293-mysterious-patchelf-linkage-bug.html">parallel strip breakage</a>.
<a href="../posts/302-Ofast-and-ffast-math-non-local-effects.html"><code>-Ofast</code></a> and
<a href="../posts/310-a-libpam-bug.html"><code>libpam</code></a> bugs were also fun.</p>
<p>The most satisfying was to
<a href="../posts/298-unexpected-runtime-dependencies-in-nixpkgs.html">reduce the runtime closure</a>
for many packages that use <code>__FILE__</code> just for for debug messages.</p>
<p>Surprisingly I managed to get about 800 commits into <code>nixpkgs</code> this year.
About ~90 of them is fixes to get compatibility with <code>gcc-13</code>. About 60
are evaluation fixes mentioned above. About 400 of them are various
package version updates.</p>
<p>I still read some of Matrix channels but I mostly skim through
<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/">discourse</a> as I have even less free time
than last year.</p>
<h2 id="home-server-experience">Home server experience</h2>
<p>I did not have to adapt anything for the past year. I switched from
<code>apache</code> to <code>nginx</code> as an <code>httpd</code> without any issues. And that’s about
it. Things Just Work.</p>
<h2 id="local-experiments">Local experiments</h2>
<p>As an experiment I gave <a href="https://hyprland.org/"><code>hyprland</code></a> a short try.
I had to switch back to <code>sway</code>. I had two issues with
<code>hyprland</code>: new applications are visibly changing layout a few times
before they settle on final window size (I could not get used to it) and
configuration language quirks (I frequently missed commas where empty
arguments are required).</p>
<p>I also did a bit of fresh <code>gcc</code> testing. This time frame also coincided
with <code>gcc-14</code> development and release cycle. <code>nixpkgs</code> ended up being a
reasonable vehicle to play with <code>gcc-14</code>. The
<a href="../posts/311-gcc-14-bug-pile-4.html">last bug pile report</a> tells me that
I found about 50 <code>gcc</code> bugs and even fixed at least
<a href="../posts/301-another-gcc-profiling-bug.html">one non-trivial one</a>.</p>
<h2 id="parting-words">Parting words</h2>
<p><code>NixOS</code> still works fine for me. I did not do as much as I managed to
last year. But looking back the list looks impressive.</p>
<p>Give it a go if you did not yet :)</p>
