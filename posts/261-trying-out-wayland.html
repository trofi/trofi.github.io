            <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>I switched to <code>wayland</code> from <code>X11</code> as my daily driver and don’t
regret it so far. It feels like it fixed more problems for me than
introduced to the point I’d prefer not to switch back.</p>
<h2 id="x11-and-default-dpi">X11 and default DPI</h2>
<p>I got my desktop monitor a few years ago. It is capable of
<code>3840x2160</code> output (172 DPI). My integrated video card could do only
<code>1920x1080</code> at most (78 DPI). I was a happy user of Xorg with
default 96 DPI settings. I was using <code>alacritty</code> as a terminal with
bitmap <code>Terminus</code> fonts carefully picked to avoid the need for glyph
hinting.</p>
<h2 id="x11-and-hidpi">X11 and HiDPI</h2>
<p>About a year ago I updated my desktop machine. I chose cheap videocard
that could output in <code>3840x2160</code> mode for my existing monitor. I wanted
to look at the use of vector fonts in the terminal.</p>
<p>I switched to HiDPI mode on <code>X11</code>. Without the special configuration
everything shrunk and became half the initial size! Arch Linux has a
detailed overview of the knobs you can tweak to get most of <code>Xorg</code>
environment upscaled: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI" class="uri">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI</a>.</p>
<p>I tried hard not to configure too many things manually. I did font
size <code>Xft.dpi: 192</code> tweak via <code>.Xresources</code>. Pictograms in many
applications (like <code>claws-mail</code>) didn’t pick up larger sizes. Mouse
cursor became almost invisible. <code>gtk-2</code> applications and older <code>X11</code>
applications that specify window sizes in pixels became unusable. I
fixed cursor <code>Xcursor.size: 64</code> via <code>.Xresources</code>. In applications
(toolkits) without good support for DPI scaling I had to artificially
increase font size and disabled pictograms in favour of text labels on
buttons.</p>
<p>Surprisingly I had to abandon a few GUI apps in favour of their terminal
equivalents as font scaling works so much better than UI element
scaling!</p>
<p>The result was looking ok-ish. But after an active use I noticed sever
tearing effect when I switch between workspaces. It was most pronounced
when I switched from <code>Firefox</code> workspace (usually white background) to
terminal workspace (black background). Tearing effect was a diagonal
blocky zip line seen for a very short while. I mitigated it with
<code>Option "TearFree" "true"</code> via <code>xorg.conf</code>. The mitigation only mostly
removes tearing effect, but not fully. Diagonal line gets turned to
horisontal line. The tearing frequency decreases to usable levels. But
it was still noticeable.</p>
<p>Looking at the final <code>X11</code> HiDPI setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>the TTF fonts now looked great in terminals</li>
<li>the UI sizes were not quite the same, usually smaller, sometimes
unreadable</li>
<li>some programs did not survive 2x downscaling and were too small to be
useful at all</li>
<li>a bit of tearing effect was present</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wayland">Wayland</h2>
<p>I’ve been meaning to try <code>wayland</code> for a while but never had an excuse.
I was afraid it will break too many applications I use frequently (or
occasionally). I vaguely remembered horror stories from past years of
things like <code>wine</code> not being able to track mouse cursor properly,
possible videocard incompatibility problems (like <code>nvidia</code>). I also
was afrad I was a too long-term <code>Xorg</code> user to easily accept minor
changes I’ll face.</p>
<p>Having looked at the amount of tweaks I had to do for HiDPI and seeing
recent <a href="https://artemis.sh/2022/09/18/wayland-from-an-x-apologist.html">An X11 Apologist Tries Wayland</a>
post I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>I used <code>i3</code> window manager in <code>Xorg</code>. Closest <code>wayland</code> sibling is
<code>sway</code>. <code>sway</code> is mostly config-compatible with <code>i3</code>: it reads
<code>~/.config/i3/config</code> if <code>~/.config/sway/config</code> does not exist.
Thus the initial switch is trivial: just run <code>sway</code>.</p>
<p><code>wayland</code> has a bit different way to handle DPI: it just assumes 96 DPI
for programs that don’t handle scaling. User needs to specify the scale
once for wayland. For me the magic command was <code>wlr-randr --output DP-3 --scale 2</code>
(or <code>output DP-3 scale 2.0</code> via <code>~/.config/sway/config</code>).</p>
<p>After that I got most old programs up to a reasonable size! It is
s omething that <code>X11</code> HiDPI could not do easily. That was a pleasant
surprise. I even undid those rare changes I had to do for HiDPI on
<code>X11</code>! <code>Xwayland</code> does a reasonable job of runnin many <code>X11</code> programs
as is. There are warts still.</p>
<p>Surprisingly under <code>wayland</code> tearing effect disappeared completely.</p>
<p>I switched to direct <code>sway</code> start from linux terminal. Before I used
<code>lightdm</code> graphical login manager (modern <code>X11</code> needed it for rootless
mode for various reasons).</p>
<p>Not everything was ideal in <code>wayland</code> world. Some unexpected things I
found:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>xeyes</code> background is garbled at start, issue known as
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/3395" class="uri">https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/3395</a></li>
<li>clicking the links in terminal does not switch the focus to the
browser, issues known as <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/4830" class="uri">https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/4830</a></li>
<li><code>Ctrl+Enter</code> does not work in <code>mc</code> (because it relies on <code>X11</code> events).
I’m slowly reading through <a href="https://wayland-book.com/" class="uri">https://wayland-book.com/</a> to get the idea
where it should ideally be implemented: in the terminal, in <code>mc</code> or
smewhere else.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="parting-words">Parting words</h2>
<p>When I read through <a href="https://wayland-book.com/" class="uri">https://wayland-book.com/</a> I got a nice feling of
being able to write nice smooth demos. Just like in <code>DOS</code> times when you
could write pixels right into video RAM at the right VSYNC time (<code>0x3da</code>
port).
It’s probably no harder in <code>X11</code>. I never got to look at X11 <code>MIT-SHM</code>
extension fearing of it’s lack of network transparency support. I spent
some time playning with
<a href="https://wayland-book.com/xdg-shell-basics/example-code.html" class="uri">https://wayland-book.com/xdg-shell-basics/example-code.html</a> example.</p>
<p>Architecturally <code>wayland</code> feels a lot like <code>X11</code>: both are RPC protocols
over UNIX socket to interact with objects on the server asynchronously
via requests and events. But the difference in the details is also
startling: frame perfect design gives a great user experience, many
things are a bit different that they used to be and require different
solution.</p>
<p>I like <code>sway/wayland</code> experience so far and will try to port a few small
things to it from <code>X11/OpenGL</code>.</p>
<p>Full <code>sway</code> config I got: <a href="https://github.com/trofi/home/blob/master/.config/sway/config" class="uri">https://github.com/trofi/home/blob/master/.config/sway/config</a>.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
