            <p><strong>PSA</strong>: I asked my <a href="mailto:slyfox@gentoo.org" class="email">slyfox@gentoo.org</a> account to be retired.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-history">a bit of history</h2>
<p>Here is a bit of my history with <code>gentoo</code> (and Linux as it overlaps for
90%).</p>
<p>I started using Linux in 2003. It was an <code>Alt Master</code> 2.2
distribution (Russian mandrake sibling). Year later I quickly degraded
(or ascended) into <code>BLFS</code>. I became <code>gentoo</code> user around 2005. I was an
undergrad and not a fully
grown up person. Arguably I’m not yet either. Let’s check in 16 years.</p>
<p>To get a feeling of what I was like here is my first (well, second)
email sent from <code>gentoo</code> box:</p>
<pre><code>Date: Thu, 3 Nov 2005 22:11:50 +0200

Hello.
 I use GQview for a long time :], but i would like to see in 
 it _MOVING_ .GIFs. Thanks a lot!!! </code></pre>
<p>I think I was asking for animated <code>.gif</code> support in <code>gqview</code>.
Message-ID reminds me that I had an odd notion of the way one claims their
own domains in internet. I pretended <code>SlyNet.org</code> belongs to me at least
in my local network of one computer.
I had just destroyed my main <code>LFS</code> system with a <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code> of fresh weekly <code>glibc</code> CVS snapshot. I set dual boot of
<code>Debian</code> and <code>gentoo</code> to try those out until I restore <code>LFS</code>.</p>
<p>I think I did my first meaningful contribution to <code>nouveau</code> project when
they collected <code>BIOS</code> dumps for video cards. At that time you would need
to patch your kernel with Pekka’s <code>MMIO</code> trace support and run <code>glxgears</code>
on Nvidia’s binary driver. Then run a script to generate <code>c</code>-looking
<code>BIOS</code> dump.
If you paste it to <code>nouveau</code> kernel driver it would be enough to get your
card running under <code>nouveau</code>! Getting if to work for the first time for
was a great feeling!</p>
<p>Around 2008 I got into <code>#gentoo-haskell</code> trying to build
<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Lambdabot" class="uri">https://wiki.haskell.org/Lambdabot</a> and trying to make any sense off
<code>haskell</code> by looking at the regression tests in <code>GHC</code> tree. Internet was
still a dial-up thing for me at home.
One of the first non-trivial bug reports I did was missing <code>AC_LARGEFILE</code>
in some parts of <code>GHC</code>. It was an inconsistent <code>getrlimit</code> struct size and
corrupted memory as a result:
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/2038" class="uri">https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/2038</a></p>
<p>Around 2009 I was on board of <code>midnight commander</code> development team, got
<code>hackage</code> upload right, adopted abandoned <code>fquery</code> tool and subscribed
to <code>lkml</code> to read it every morning on train to work and back (2 hours per
day). I also sent my first non-trivial bug report to kernel around <code>i915</code>
video chip and a month later got my first trivial commit to <code>linux</code> kernel:
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=168f5ac668f63dfb64439766e3ef9e866b83719d" class="uri">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=168f5ac668f63dfb64439766e3ef9e866b83719d</a>.
I aspired to get at least one commit to <code>linux</code>, <code>gcc</code>, <code>glibc</code> and <code>binutils</code>
one day. I never dreamed of commit bit to those projects. They all
looked complex, magic and flawless. I thought the time order would be
(in order of perceived to be required knowledge): <code>binutils</code>, <code>glibc</code>, <code>gcc</code>,
<code>linux</code>. It ended up being exactly the opposite and has very little to do
with knowledge or complexity.</p>
<p>Also around 2009 I (as upstream) received first contribution to <code>mc</code>
part I was responsible for: <code>ebuild</code> file syntax highlighting in <code>mcedit</code>
(a bunch of keywords). It was from Lars, <code>gentoo</code> staffer by then. I though,
wow, being a <code>gentoo</code> dev is very cool! Maybe one day I’ll have a chance?
I did a <code>mc</code> live <code>ebuild</code> for my own use after all!
And by the end of 2009 Lennart mentored me as a new <code>gentoo</code> dev to help
him with <code>haskell</code> packages: <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/296463" class="uri">https://bugs.gentoo.org/296463</a>. In 6 months
I got the <code>CVS</code> commit bit! My first <code>ebuild</code> was an <code>xmms2</code> one. Mike
helped me to shape it up in <code>gentoo-dev@</code> mailing list.</p>
<p>It took me about 6 years to start meaningfully contribute to the FOSS
community. Such a long time. If you think of contributing and have not
started yet then start today. It is trivial and fun.</p>
<p><code>gentoo</code> gave me access to various exotic platforms. First thing first I
tried to refresh <code>GHC</code> binary on <code>alpha</code>, <code>ia64</code>, <code>powerpc</code> and <code>sparc</code>.
<code>GHC</code> required fancy fixes on each of them. In case of <code>sparc</code> Mike
fixed <code>glibc</code> for me first: <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/336792#c13" class="uri">https://bugs.gentoo.org/336792#c13</a>. Years
later I was able to debug similar <code>PIE</code>-related bugs myself.</p>
<p>Roughly around that time Google contacted me for the first time and I
failed the onsite interview in Zurich. That was my first time to visit
an English speaking Europe country.</p>
<p>In 2010 a good friend of mine gave me <code>sheevaplug</code> <code>armv5tel</code> device to play
with embedding <code>gentoo</code> into it. He helped me to file
<a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/333679" class="uri">https://bugs.gentoo.org/333679</a> to get missing <code>openssl</code> speed up
improvements.</p>
<p>In 2011 I managed to debug and fix very scary data corruption bug on
<code>btrfs</code>:
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3387206f26e1b48703e810175b98611a4fd8e8ea" class="uri">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3387206f26e1b48703e810175b98611a4fd8e8ea</a>
and then severe degradation on <code>--mixed</code> <code>btrfs</code> filesystems:
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c4f675cd40d955d539180506c09515c90169b15b" class="uri">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c4f675cd40d955d539180506c09515c90169b15b</a></p>
<p>On <code>alpha</code> in attempt to follow some outdated guide in <code>openssl</code>
alignment debugging I accidentally fixed some very obscure <code>setsysinfo()</code>
interface nobody seemed to use:
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=2df7a7d1cd07626dd235ca102830ebfc6c01a09e" class="uri">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=2df7a7d1cd07626dd235ca102830ebfc6c01a09e</a>
That helped me to find a bug on <code>alpha</code> in <code>OPENSSL_cleanse()</code> function.
It was my first encounter of <code>openssl</code> <code>perl</code> scripts to generate the
assembly. Only later I found out that standard <code>prctl --unaligned=signal</code>
Just Works for the same purpose :)</p>
<p>In the same 2011 I mentored Mark to get on board with <code>gentoo</code> dev to help
me with <code>haskell</code>.</p>
<p>In the same 2011 I tried to fix a few prominent packages to support
<code>x32</code> ABI and stumbled on <code>xorg</code> devs who refused to accept that
<code>__x86_64__</code> can be an <code>ilp32</code> system. It was eventually
accepted upstream but I gave up quickly being blocked by <code>xorg</code>.</p>
<p>In 2012 at a day job I got to work at an <code>x86</code> emulator and extended my
interests to <code>qemu</code> and interpreters. Few trivial fixes landed into
<code>qemu</code>. I also botched the <code>qemu</code> <code>ebuild</code> down to a state when <code>qemu</code>
VMs could not boot anymore. Doug was rightfully upset. I settled on
butchering my own live <code>ebuild</code>.</p>
<p>About the same time I started taking on maintenance of other tiny
packages, like <code>sys-block/seekwatcher</code>, <code>app-misc/bb</code> and other
non-<code>haskell</code> stuff.</p>
<p>I mentored Alexander on board of <code>gentoo</code> dev to help me with <code>haskell</code>
packages.</p>
<p>In 2012 Google contacted me second time and I failed phone interview for
a Haskell position in Munich.</p>
<p>At the end of 2012 I mentored Heather to join <code>gentoo</code> devs and help me
with <code>haskell</code>. Heather also maintained <code>c#</code>-related packages that
required very special expertise nobody except Heather had.</p>
<p>I submitted my first <code>tmpfilesd.eclass</code> in 2012 for review and it was shot
down as unneeded. Only to be added in 2016 by someone else. There are my
communication skills at that time (and now, really).</p>
<p>In 2013 my mentor Lennart retired from <code>gentoo</code> dev and moved on to
<code>Fedora</code>.</p>
<p>I fixed a memory leak in long-running <code>CVS</code> sessions which allowed me
to convert whole of <code>gentoo</code> <code>CVS</code> tree into <code>git</code> as a single <code>git cvsimport</code> run.</p>
<p>I took on <code>GHC</code> maintenance in <code>gentoo</code>: building binaries on a few stalled
arches, fixing obscure <code>GHC</code> or <code>haskell</code> bugs that happened only on exotic
arches. I found out all the gory details of how <code>RTS</code> <code>adjustors</code> worked and
how <code>libffi</code> was (slightly incorrectly) hooked to them.
Later I took on cross-compiler cleanup and maintenance of upstream <code>GHC</code>
around unregisterised backend. It was a great way to understand <code>GHC</code>
evaluation model and unique debugging tricks.</p>
<p>I upstreamed by Most Important Ever patch to linux kernel to enable
<code>-Werror=implicit-int</code> prompted by hardened-specific backport gone
wrong I had on <code>btrfs</code>:
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=80970472179a45609c0b11b80619bc8c32b15f77" class="uri">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=80970472179a45609c0b11b80619bc8c32b15f77</a>
It reminds me that I used a hardened kernel at work at that time. I fixed
a few packages for it. Somehow it was the simplest way to fix
hardened-specific bugs. Many hardened users frequently refused to show
any <code>build.log</code> and described the problems as they see it without actual
evidence.</p>
<p>I mentored Michael to join <code>gentoo</code> devs to work on various packages.</p>
<p>I was contacted by Google yet again and finally passed the interview. In
2014 I moved to London. My first commit to <code>gentoo</code> <code>portage</code> program
also happened that year.</p>
<p>I did my first substantial change to <code>ghc-package.eclass</code> to support new
style package database and while at it got rid of many orphan <code>haskell</code>
config files on <code>gentoo</code>. That was probably my first successful <code>eclass</code>
work.</p>
<p>In 2015 I subscribed to <code>gentoo-project@</code> because I was nominated for
<code>council@</code> for the first time /o\. I did not really know what happens in
that list until then as it never popped up in a day-to-day work.</p>
<p>I unsubscribed from <code>lkml</code> as I had no time to read after the move. I
subscribed to <code>libc-alpha@</code> (<code>glibc</code> mailing list). I got my first
<code>gcc</code> patch upstreamed to properly fix <code>ia64</code> <a href="../posts/189-glibc-on-ia64-or-how-relocations-bootstrap.html">relocations</a>.</p>
<p><code>gentoo</code> moved from <code>CVS</code> to <code>git</code> which made it a lot easier for external
users to contribute. It felt like development speed accelerated quite a
bit since.</p>
<p>In 2016 I fixed <code>GHC</code> on <code>m68k</code> to mostly test how easy it is to
cross-compile <code>GHC</code> on something I never tried <a href="../posts/191-ghc-on-m68k.html">before</a>.</p>
<p>In 2017 I fixed kernel module loading on <code>ia64</code> that broke by my <code>gcc</code>
patch <a href="../posts/199-ia64-machine-emulation.html">from 2015</a>.</p>
<p>I also was elected as a member of <code>gentoo</code> <code>council@</code> for the first time. It
was an eye opening event: I had only vague idea what council actually
does, yet I nominated. I wonder if most of devs generally have as much
feeling about it. That’s a scary thought on how election process
actually go and what it achieves. It also explains why I was elected at
all :)</p>
<p>Mike stopped contributing to toolchain packages. I joined newly formed
<code>toolchain@</code> team in <code>gentoo</code> to maintain <code>gcc</code>. At that point I got some
expertise to fix <code>GHC</code> on various arches and was a very frequent user of
<code>crossdev</code>. This naturally exposed me to very rare arch-specific
cross-specific build bugs. First <code>gcc</code> I pushed to <code>gentoo</code> was <code>gcc-6.4.0</code>.
First major <code>gcc</code> was probably a <code>gcc-7</code>. I don’t remember anything special
about it. Probably because I had no idea what I was doing.</p>
<p>Later I found out about <code>nix</code> and <code>guix</code> as an elegant solution not to break
your existing system while building an update to the new one. It felt a
bit clunky as a <code>gentoo</code> replacement. It feels like the right solution,
but it also requires quite a bit of time investment.</p>
<p>Later <code>gentoo</code> enabled <code>17.0</code> profiles with <code>USE=pie</code> enabled by default.
I hoped (and
asked) that <code>clang</code>, <code>go</code>, <code>ocaml</code>, <code>crystal</code> would follow <code>gcc</code> lead of
<code>-fPIE</code> by defaults (and <code>-fstack-protector</code> while at it). But it never
happened.
It keeps biting users and keeps providing inconsistent results when
trying to mix the binaries and libraries from different toolchains.</p>
<p>In 2017 I was kicked out of <code>#gentoo-dev</code> IRC channel over a seemingly
minor issue. It was not an isolated incident. By the time it was clear
part of <code>gentoo</code> dev community had different views and values from mine on
what is appropriate in casual conversations. I realized it was a big
effort to sift through bile and snarky comments on <code>#gentoo-dev</code> in
search of something constructive. I never came back.</p>
<p>I did not feel my contributions were welcomed at the time and started
thinking of resignation. New <code>toolchain@</code> and <code>council@</code> roles cheered
me up slightly and allowed me to distract from the thought.
That was the time when I could no longer safely expand my interests in
<code>gentoo</code>. I started explicitly avoiding quite a few areas and distance
myself from very toxic environments.
I realized I’ll eventually lose the connection with <code>gentoo</code> development
in general and fall behind the development practices. In this regard I
was probably the worst <code>council@</code> member ever :)</p>
<p><code>sparc</code> architecture support went from <code>stable</code> to <code>exp</code> support status
for a short while as we lost our last <code>sparc</code> dev box from HDD hardware
failure.</p>
<p>I think demoting to <code>exp</code> was a good move. It signaled people to step in
and save the platform support by getting new fancy hardware, by setting
it up and starting more active stabilization process by. Rolf++ saved
<code>sparc</code> and <code>hppa</code>. He still diligently files bugs that ought to be filed
and fixed by maintainers themselves. I think over time we found a few
non-trivial bugs that benefit every arch as a result.</p>
<p>I personally think portability is a great asset of <code>gentoo</code>. Mechanically
it’s a great way to find future bugs. <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/613418" class="uri">https://bugs.gentoo.org/613418</a>
is a good example when unexpected memory overlap in inplace arithmetic
on long numbers caused problems on <code>sparc</code> first but could (and will)
happen on <code>x86_64</code>.</p>
<p>In 2018 I debugged very fancy hardware memory fault on my machine
related to
<a href="../posts/209-tracking-down-mysterious-memory-corruption.html">non-temporal instructions handling</a>.
By then I saw everything :)</p>
<p>A bit later Alexander retired from <code>gentoo</code> and moved on to <code>nixos</code>
ecosystem.</p>
<p>In 2019 I removed <code>13.0</code> profiles as their presence slowed <code>repoman</code> down
and gave an impression of <code>13.0</code> to stay forever while devs did not
normally test software on it: <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/672960" class="uri">https://bugs.gentoo.org/672960</a>. As a
result we found out infra used <code>13.0</code> as well. Whoops.</p>
<p>In 2019 I joined <code>riscv</code> project to help with basic toolchain support. I
think I only made a minor <code>glibc</code> tweak.</p>
<p>In 2020 I started working on <code>gcc-10</code> which (who knew!) lexicographically
is less than <code>gcc-9</code> and that broke software in
<a href="../posts/213-gcc-10-in-gentoo.html">very unusual ways</a>.
As you can see in that post <code>gcc-10</code> was very harsh on it’s users. It
took us a long time to get reverse dependencies fixed. To isolate users
from simplest bugs and be able to discover breakages early I decided to
switch my main development box to <code>gcc</code> built from <code>git</code>. I hope I
succeeded at catching one or two of those
<a href="../posts/224-a-year-on-gcc-from-git.html">before the release</a>.
My goal as part of <code>toolchain@</code> was to clean up and forward all
<code>gcc</code>-related failures that looked like compiler problems: be it <code>LTO</code>,
<code>PGO</code>, exotic <code>-m*</code> or <code>-f*</code> flags being used or cross-compiler support.
It’s a joy to see enthusiasts try out various fancy setups I could never
come up with myself and get it to work together.
And it’s always sad to see when people just disable certain
optimizations in <code>ebuild</code>s without a bug report or any specifics. Almost
always there is a proper fix lurking on toolchain side, client project
or both.</p>
<p>To help Agostino find packages that don’t follow <code>${CHOST}-${tool}</code>
convention I added <code>USE=-native-symlinks</code> to <code>gcc-config</code> and
<code>binutils-config</code>:
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Toolchain/use_native_symlinks" class="uri">https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Toolchain/use_native_symlinks</a>
This tiny effort shown an interesting detail of <code>gentoo</code> dev community:
everybody has slightly different notion of what <code>gentoo</code> provides as an
interface to the user.
In this specific example is how many variables should user override in
<code>make.conf</code> to get <code>CC</code> applied? Just <code>CC</code>? Or also <code>CC_FOR_BUILD</code>? Or
maybe <code>HOST_CC</code>? How about <code>CHOST</code> override? Should it affect <code>CC</code>
automatically or user also has to specify <code>CC</code>?
My opinion is seemingly very simple: for native builds <code>${CHOST}-gcc</code>
should be used for all build systems to (until overridden). But not
everyone shares it. Mismatch causes cross-compilation failures on a
regular basis.
Ideally QA would help us here to establish some guidance. Any written
convention would be fine. But that did not happen yet:
<a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/726034" class="uri">https://bugs.gentoo.org/726034</a>.</p>
<p>In 2020 I got commit bit in <code>gcc</code>, <code>binutils</code> and <code>llvm</code> projects for a
few small contributions. That gave me the confidence to contribute more.
That looks like a great model.</p>
<p>In 2021 Heather retired from <code>gentoo</code> dev.</p>
<p>Wolfgang (my mentee) was rejected as a <code>gentoo</code> dev candidate. This was
my failure as a mentor. It’s a sign I’m not up to speed with current
<code>gentoo</code> development practices and should step down.</p>
<p>I unassigned myself as a maintainer from all the packages. I left all
the <code>gentoo</code> teams.</p>
<p>Losing access to exotic arches if a bit unfortunate, but maybe it will
force me to improve <code>qemu</code> a bit. Or get hardware access via other
means :D</p>
<h2 id="possible-improvements">Possible improvements</h2>
<p>On developer pool size and their will to contribute. I personally think
quizzies cover both too much and too little of the scope to evaluate the
candidate for an ultimate question if having them onboarded now would be
net benefit or not. For example <code>::haskell</code> occasionally gets active and
diligent contributors that don’t have much interest outside <code>haskell</code>
packages. I don’t see a reason not to allow them to sync their work to
<code>::gentoo</code>.</p>
<p>On information flow around <code>gentoo</code>-wide. <code>council@</code>, <code>trustees@</code>,
<code>qa@</code>, <code>infra@</code>
topics like new policies or decisions being made. Would be nice to
always post those to <code>gentoo-dev-announce@</code>. As a crazy idea it might help
<code>gentoo</code> if each new member joined over past 2 years would personally be
invited to lurk in one of council meetings to get the idea what they are
usually about. And get meeting logs back over the email in case they
could not make it. For example I still have no idea what decisions <code>qa@</code>
did over past 5 years.</p>
<p>On policy clarification requests against <code>qa@</code>. Perhaps monthly meetings
could go through bug backlog to have follow-up and steps to closure.</p>
<p>On lack of basic tooling or tool fragmentation. I think <code>gentoo</code> needs
more trivial ubiquitous tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>tool to file a bug report based on failed <code>build.log</code> without much
manual fiddling. Or even better a portage prompt when encountered.</li>
<li>tool to file a stabilization (or keywording) request for users</li>
<li>tool to continuously perform builds for CCed arches in bugs and have
the ability to keyword/stable packages without manual interaction from
arch team (unless requested explicitly). It might also be a natural
place to maintain some form of <code>binpkgs</code> in <code>gentoo</code>.</li>
<li>tool to setup and enter <code>chroot</code></li>
<li>tool to run the QA checks against all the packages one maintains
without resort to hacking up their own big wrappers.</li>
<li>many other tools for daily use I forgot</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of them are implementable in 5 lines of code as a start. It would
be a great start to improve quality of reports and interaction.</p>
<h2 id="parting-words">Parting words</h2>
<p>I’ll probably still be around for a while as a <code>gentoo</code> user. No more
<code>ia64</code> access though :)</p>
<p>These past 11 years had their nice moments.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
