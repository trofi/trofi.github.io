            <p>Yet another year has passed since I switched to <code>NixOS</code> as my main
desktop system. Time to look back and see how it went
(<a href="../posts/257-a-year-on-nixos.html">2022 instance</a>).</p>
<h2 id="system-maintenance">System maintenance</h2>
<p>I did not have any problems related to package build failures for any
amount of time on <code>nixos-unstable</code>. Probably because I did a bit of
testing when changes were in <code>staging</code>.</p>
<p>I had to deal with a few fallouts around configuration changes related
to upgrades:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fontconfig</code> font hinting default changed: </posts>.
I had to set explicit defaults to restore font rendering.</li>
<li><code>pipewire</code> configuration layout changed and I had to slightly adapt
my non-standard socket overrides: <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/220332#issuecomment-1480119470" class="uri">https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/220332#issuecomment-1480119470</a></li>
<li>I followed rename of <code>boot.tmpOn*</code> options to <code>boot.tmp.*</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All 3 were easy to track down and fix. It’s a bit more maintenance than
last year’s but still manageable.</p>
<h2 id="community-support">Community support</h2>
<p><code>NixOS</code> community remains to be a friendly place that welcomes
newcomers, experiments and day-to-day maintenance work. I have not seen
instances of large conflicts or abusive behaviours towards anyone.</p>
<p>I had a few chances to interact with wider community by attempting
larger-scale <code>nixpkgs</code> changes: I succeeded on one change and failed on
another change.</p>
<p>More successful change was
<a href="../posts/282-parallel-installs-in-nixpkgs.html">enabling parallel installs by default</a>.
It’s a good example of a small change with small impact that touches
most packages. I managed to speed up quite a few slow-to-install
packages without major regressions. We have 32 <code>nixpkgs</code> packages marked
with
<a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ANixOS%2Fnixpkgs+%22enableParallelInstalling+%3D+false%22&amp;type=code"><code>enableParallelInstalling = false</code></a>.
The rest should install in parallel (as long as a package builds in
parallel).</p>
<p>Less successful change was the initially minor
<a href="../posts/275-nixpkgs-bootstrap-deep-dive.html">bootstrap process change</a>.
It’s a good example of a medium change with some impact on most
packages. I successfully pushed a few small cleanups but ended up
reverting larger changes. Those exposed bugs either in changes
themselves (<code>gcc</code> bootstrap is hard) or on incorrect assumptions of
downstream packages. This change is also very hard to communicate:
people tend to dismiss finer details of the change and don’t see the
reason for a particular change. Maybe I’ll try again next year :) In any
case I learned a lot in the process!</p>
<p>I follow Matrix channels even less than I did last year as I focus a bit
more on personal and select <code>nixpkgs</code> projects.</p>
<h2 id="maintenance-model">Maintenance model</h2>
<p>I think <code>nixpkgs</code> maintenance model still holds today. There are <code>RFC</code>s
like <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/127">RFC127</a> to label
problematic packages in a more fine-grained form than just
<code>ok</code>/<code>broken</code>. Most updates are still done by a
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/graphs/contributors">robot</a>
auto-updater.</p>
<p>Looking at
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/graphs/commit-activity">commit activity</a>
<code>nixpkgs</code> gets about 1000 commits a week. That’s a lot.</p>
<h2 id="home-server-experience">Home server experience</h2>
<p>Don’t have anything to complain about here. The server required zero
maintenance from me this year as well.</p>
<p>The only thing I changed was the switch from <code>nixos-unstable</code> to direct
<code>master</code> branch from <code>nixpkgs</code> to get upstream kernel upgrades slightly
faster at the expense of local kernel build.</p>
<p>Fun fact: when I had a <a href="../posts/280-cooling-failure.html">cooling failure</a>
on my main desktop system I switched to home server as my main machine.
It took a few config lines to turn a headless machine to wayland desktop
(and then back a week later when repair finished). As it’s an old
machine I noticed how some builds are slower than they ought to be. This
prompted me to work on
<a href="../posts/282-parallel-installs-in-nixpkgs.html">parallel installs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="local-experiments">Local experiments</h2>
<p>I switched my machine configurations to
<a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes">flake</a>-based configuration to have
configuration update history in a single <code>/etc/nixos</code> <code>git</code> repository.</p>
<p>While at it I also switched my desktop from <code>nixos-unstable</code> channel
directly to <code>master</code> branch to get latest kernels and <code>firefox</code> as soon
as they are available. This means a bit of local compiling from time to
time.</p>
<p>I switched from <code>i3+x11</code> to <code>wayland+sway</code> as my main desktop window
manager. This exposed minor bugs in
<a href="../posts/265-waypipe-fixes.html">waypipe</a> and even
<a href="../posts/268-fixing-wine-wayland-on-polaris.html">wine</a>!</p>
<h2 id="parting-words">Parting words</h2>
<p><code>NixOS</code> still works fine for me. Compared to last year I was able to do
larger projects within <code>NixOS</code> community (bootstrap, parallel builds,
closure shrinking, large package updates, …) and outside <code>NixOS</code>
community (<code>gcc</code>, <code>wayland</code>, <code>xmms2</code>, <code>ski</code>, …).</p>
<p>Give it a go if you did not yet :)</p>
