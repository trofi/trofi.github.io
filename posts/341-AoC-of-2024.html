            <p>Almost a year later I finally finished <code>AoC</code> 2024:
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024" class="uri">https://adventofcode.com/2024</a>.
My solutions: <a href="https://github.com/trofi/AoC/tree/main/2024" class="uri">https://github.com/trofi/AoC/tree/main/2024</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to last year I managed to solve most of problem within a day of
them being published with a single exception of
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/21">problem 21</a>. That one took me
most of 2025 :)</p>
<p>As usual problems were appearing once a day at 5AM from Dec 1 to Dec 25.
Nowadays I get up at 6 AM. Sometimes I had a chance to at least read the
problem descriptions in the morning and try to solve in the evening.</p>
<p>My personal goal was to solve the problems within 24 hours of publish
time and get the source code under <code>4K</code>. I failed it in a few problems.
Again, I used <code>rust</code>. I tried not to use external crates but I started
using <code>cargo</code> and <code>workspaces</code> to make <code>rust-analyzer</code> and <code>cargo run</code>
to Just Work in the source directory. I enabled <code>cargo</code> very late once
I got stuck on <code>problem 21</code>.</p>
<h2 id="funniest-problems">Funniest problems</h2>
<p>Most of the problems felt slightly easier than last year’s ones (where
I did not get past <code>problem 21</code>).</p>
<p>Again, there are no miracles in the solutions I did. If they ran in a
few seconds time I did not do much to tune them. But some of them
required a pencil and paper style solution. Those were great!</p>
<p>Here is my list of fun problems I remembered:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3">Day 3: Mull It Over</a>:
slightly unusual problem where I had the chance to use
<a href="https://re2c.org/"><code>re2c</code></a> lexer generator.</li>
<li><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/12">Day 12: Garden Groups</a>:
while being one of the typical graph traversal problems I liked
how part 2 could be solved entirely with primitives built from part 1.</li>
<li><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/17">Day 17: Chronospatial Computer</a>:
an opportunity to write a CPU emulator! I could not resist. Part 2
required me a bit of pencil and paper.</li>
<li><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/20">Day 20: Race Condition</a>:
it’s a nice form of finding shortest path in the maze with a warp
twist.</li>
<li><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/21">Day 21: Keypad Conundrum</a>:
a simple “control the robot with a keypad” problem. Part 2 has a great
twist.</li>
<li><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/24">Day 24: Crossed Wires</a>:
part 2is a deceptively simple problem description that I found easier
to solve by staring into <code>graphviz</code> output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks like this year we had even more graph traversal problems. Quick
grep for <code>visited</code> says it is <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
