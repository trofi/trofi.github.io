<p>You really want some frontend to manipulate the player.</p>
<p>I usually run a shell wrapper in a directory I want to play.
Effectively I’m using my window manager as a frontend:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mc</strong> in <strong>alacritty</strong> to run <strong>m</strong> in a directory I want to play: <a href="https://github.com/trofi/home/blob/master/.bash/funs#L19">script</a></li>
<li><strong>i3</strong> key bindings to navigate through song and playlist: <a href="https://github.com/trofi/home/blob/master/.config/i3/config#L30">config</a></li>
<li><strong>xmobar</strong> (with <a href="https://github.com/trofi/home/blob/master/bin/player-status-entry-persist.py">a formatter</a>) as a status output.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="why-xmms2">why xmms2?</h1>
<p>My path to <strong>xmms2</strong> was fun. My first audio player program was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp#Winamp_2">winamp 2</a> on windows 98.
When I switched to linux I picked closest alternative (and even brought
my favourite hacker skin). It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMMS">xmms</a>.</p>
<p><strong>xmms</strong> was a good player. But it’s upstream development stalled. It
was using <strong>gtk-1</strong> at the time when everyone else was migrating to
<strong>gtk-2</strong>. A bunch of <strong>gtk-2</strong> forks appeared and none looked close
enough to <strong>xmms</strong>. Some had too thick UI buttons, some had problems
playing enough audio formats I had. Most did not support <strong>xmms</strong> skins
and were not able to present their status as a 16-pixel high window
somewhere on the desktop.</p>
<p><strong>xmms2</strong> was a new project that aimed to be <strong>xmms</strong> done right
architecturally. I read the initial announcement at the
time and though it will eventually be just like <strong>xmms</strong>. Haha. I tried
<strong>xmms2</strong> out and was able to play all song formats I had. I was surprised
to see how quickly it builds from source.</p>
<p><strong>xmms2</strong> felt incomplete as it planned but never implemented GUI
client. Eventually <strong>abraca</strong> materialized but I never got to run
it: I already settled on my set of CLI hacks to play things.</p>
<p>Eventually <strong>xmms2</strong> development pace was slowing down. I was wondering
if there are any direct alternatives to <strong>xmms2</strong> out there. <strong>mpd</strong>
looked like a close match. But when I tried it I found <strong>xmms2</strong>
snappier to add files to the database and to scroll along the playlists
with <strong>i3</strong> keybindings. I suspect <strong>mpd</strong> was not optimised for that
use case. I never moved off <strong>xmms2</strong>. I still plan to add <strong>UNI</strong> module
file format support to <strong>xmms2</strong> via <strong>libmikmod</strong> or similar :)</p>
