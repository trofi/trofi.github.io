            <h2 id="fno-commn-in-gentoo">-fno-commn in ::gentoo</h2>
<p>Around January 2020 (more than 2 years ago) <strong>gcc</strong> development version
switched the default from <strong>-fcommon</strong> to <strong>-fno-common</strong>: <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/PR85678" class="uri">https://gcc.gnu.org/PR85678</a>.</p>
<p>I personally like <strong>-fno-common</strong> as it catches accidental
global variable name collision like the one in
<a href="https://github.com/FreeSpacenav/spacenavd/commit/7c271fa265613bd7d47601daaeb0e08e7c5b5a75">spacenavd</a>
or in <strong>iozone</strong>. Occasional upstreams’
<a href="https://github.com/FreeSpacenav/spacenavd/issues/17">reluctance</a>
to make code <strong>-fno-common</strong>-compatible was a big surprise to me. I just
don’t see any benefit of commoning. Luckily such a reluctance is rare.</p>
<p>I built local system with <strong>-fno-common</strong> toolchain and found 16 buggy
packages: <strong>syslinux</strong>, <strong>tftp-hpa</strong>, <strong>minicom</strong>, <strong>freeglut</strong>, <strong>openrc</strong>,
<strong>iproute2</strong>, <strong>gpm</strong>, <strong>xorg-server</strong>, <strong>logrotate</strong>, <strong>gnupg</strong>, <strong>libtirpc</strong>,
<strong>gdbm</strong>, <strong>cpio</strong>, <strong>postfix</strong>, <strong>xfsprogs</strong> and even <strong>glibc</strong>. Some are
very high profile packages. I had ~2K packages installed locally.</p>
<p>I extrapolated 16 failures per 2K packages to 20K packages
of the whole ::gentoo repository (~10x) and hoped that we won’t get
more than 160 failures. My intuition was saying that most of other
packages should be <strong>python</strong>, <strong>ruby</strong>, <strong>perl</strong>, <strong>php</strong> packages
and are probably unaffeched. Thus the final number could be lower
than 100. That sounded like a manageable fallout.</p>
<p>When Toralf started <strong>CFLAGS=-fno-common</strong> <strong>tinderbox</strong> build test
on the whole ::gentoo repository he began discovering more failures.
I proposed fixes for first few tens of failure and was quicly overwhelmed
with more failure reports. After a few weeks of <strong>tinderbox</strong> run
the <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/705764">bug list</a> collected ~800 failures!</p>
<p>800 is 5 times worse than I estimated. It’s 4% of the repository. Some of those
reports are probably duplicates but vast majority are unique real failures.
If I knew it’s so widespread I might have taken another way to roll it out.
Alas. Anyway, by now <strong>-fno-common</strong> is a fixed problem for Gentoo.</p>
<h2 id="fno-common-in-nixpkgs">-fno-common in nixpkgs</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago I got commit access to <strong>nixpkgs</strong>. I’m still feeling a
bit uneasy about it as I don’t formally maintain any packages there. At
least I have a few PRs to merge :)</p>
<p>Scrolling through pull requests I noticed that <strong>nixpkgs</strong> actually flipped
<strong>gcc-10</strong> (and <strong>llvm-11</strong>) default back to <strong>-fcommon</strong> to avoid widespread
breakage. And there was a PR to restore the default:
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/110571" class="uri">https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/110571</a>. Having a bit more
collaborative tools at my disposal I decided to sort it out for <strong>nixpkgs</strong>.
I messed it up once before and learned something. Should be easy this time :)</p>
<p><strong>-fno-commn</strong> default was relased as <strong>gcc-10.1.0</strong> on May 7. That
makes it almost exactly 2 years ago. Since then some projects adapted to
<strong>-fno-common</strong> uptream and released newer versions. But some did not.
What is the ratio of those?</p>
<p>For still broken packages I usually write a patch against dormant
upstream and attach it to the bug tracker so others could use patch
as is even if patch does not get merged in any form.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is no place upstream to make patch publicly available.
In this case I resort to <strong>NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = “-fcommon”</strong> in <strong>.nix</strong>
expressions. So far I had to do it in 10 packages (maybe 30% of all
I tried to fix?). I hope it will save some time to others.</p>
<p>If you are the author of a package that had no release in past 2 years
and have a few minor tweaks then consider releasing it. Maybe you even
have a <strong>-fno-common</strong> fix pending?</p>
<h2 id="update-from-8-july-2022">Update from 8 July 2022</h2>
<p><strong>-fno-common</strong> change was merged into <strong>nixpkgs</strong>. Some stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>240 packages were broken (down from 800 in Gentoo). Only 30% were
still affected and 70% were already fixed upstream and trickled down
to downstream.</li>
<li>About 140 of unfixed packages got <strong>-fcommon</strong> workaround in <strong>nixpkgs</strong>.
This means ~60% did not have any form of an upstream fix and 40% did
(or do now).</li>
<li>It took me 2 months to do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have fun!</p>
